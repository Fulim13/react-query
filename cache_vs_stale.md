In React Query, `cacheTime` and `staleTime` are configuration options that control the caching behavior of your queries.

1. `cacheTime`: This is the time in milliseconds that unused (inactive) data is allowed to stay in the cache before it is automatically deleted. When a query is no longer used by your application, it becomes inactive. If `cacheTime` is set to 0, the cache for the inactive queries will be cleared immediately. The default value is 5 minutes.

2. `staleTime`: This is the time in milliseconds that data remains fresh. After this time, React Query will mark the data as stale and refetch in the background when the query is next used. If `staleTime` is set to Infinity, the data will never become stale. The default value is 0, meaning data is immediately stale and will be refetched on each new render.

You would use these settings to control the balance between having fresh data and minimizing server requests. For example, if you have data that doesn't change often, you might set a long `staleTime`. If you have data that changes frequently, you might set a short `staleTime`. Similarly, if you want to keep data in cache for inactive queries for a longer time, you would set a long `cacheTime`.

Here's an example of how you might use these options in a query:

```javascript
useQuery('todos', fetchTodos, {
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // data is fresh for 5 minutes
  cacheTime: 1000 * 60 * 30, // unused data is deleted from the cache after 30 minutes
})
```

In this example, once the 'todos' data is fetched, it will not be refetched for 5 minutes, even if the 'todos' query is used elsewhere in your application. After 5 minutes, the data becomes stale, and React Query will refetch the data in the background the next time the 'todos' query is used. If the 'todos' query is not used for 30 minutes, the data is removed from the cache.

`cacheTime` in React Query refers to how long the data from a query will be kept in cache after the query becomes inactive (i.e., when you navigate away from a page that uses the data). If you navigate back to the page within the cacheTime, React Query will use the cached data instead of making a new request to the server.

`staleTime` refers to how long the data is considered fresh after it's fetched. If the data is still fresh (i.e., the staleTime hasn't passed), React Query won't make a new request to the server when you use the query. Instead, it will use the existing data. Once the staleTime has passed, React Query will still show the cached data immediately, but it will also make a background request to the server to update the data.

So, in summary:

`cacheTime` controls how long inactive data stays in the cache.
`staleTime` controls how long fresh data stays fresh. After data becomes stale, React Query will refetch it in the background the next time the query is used.
